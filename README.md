Welcome to my profile! If you're wondering about my name, Claudiu Chelcea, just think of the English football club Chelsea ⚽ – but note, it's just a mnemonic and not a pronunciation guide! 😆

I am an avid learner and strive for excellence in all that I do. This drive has led me through a diverse array of experiences, enriching my skills and broadening my perspectives.

👨‍💻 Professional Background: With a solid foundation in Computer Science Engineering, I've developed an extensive portfolio of projects ranging from games and automation scripts to websites and blockchain applications, most of which are showcased on my GitHub. My technical skills are complemented by strong competencies in SQL, Python, Excel, and VBA, which I utilize to enhance and automate processes in my current role at Ubisoft as a Monetization Specialist.

📊 Leadership and Development: My proactive nature and self-improvement ethos have earned me leadership roles, notably as the President of a major student NGO and as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant. I have also undertaken significant Project Management trainings and have mentored numerous students.

💹 Business and Investment: A keen interest in business and blockchain technology has led me to co-found EcoLand, an international blockchain project gaining traction through significant partnerships and investments. Additionally, I am an active investor in stocks and cryptocurrencies, pairing very well with my analytical mind.

🎮 Industry Experience: At Ubisoft and previously at Gameloft, my contributions have significantly impacted game monetization strategies and overall revenue growth. These roles have allowed me to leverage my skills in game design, economic modeling, and live operations management to deliver compelling user experiences.

I'm also known to be very friendly, so feel free to connect or drop me a message for a chat! 💬
