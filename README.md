### Welcome to my profile!

Hey, Iâ€™m Claudiu - Monetization Specialist at Ubisoft. I design systems that make games more engaging and profitable. From revamping Battle Passes, balancing economies, to launching high-performing events and offers, Iâ€™ve worked on features that players love and that drive real business results.

Iâ€™ve worked across both AAA and mobile games, and for me, itâ€™s never been about the platform - an economy is an economy. Whether it's on console or phone, the core challenge is the same: building smart systems that respect players while keeping them invested.

On the technical side, I use SQL, Excel, Looker, Python, and VBA to dig into data, run simulations, track performance, and automate workflows.

Iâ€™m confident in my numbers, systems thinking, and how I work with people. I enjoy solving tough problems, sharing ideas, and learning from others. Also - Iâ€™m super easy to talk to, so feel free to reach out anytime. ðŸ’¬
