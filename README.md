### Welcome to my profile!

I'm Claudiu Chelcea, a Monetization Specialist at Ubisoft with a Computer Science Engineering background. My expertise lies in game economy design, live operations, and monetization strategies, with impactful contributions at both Ubisoft and Gameloft. I've successfully managed in-game stores, developed high-performing events, and implemented innovative monetization features that have driven significant revenue growth.

Beyond gaming, I'm deeply interested in business and digital transformation, currently pursuing an MBA focused on digital businesses. I co-founded EcoLand, a blockchain gaming company, and actively invest in stocks and cryptocurrencies.

My technical skills in SQL, Python, Excel, and VBA have been pivotal in automating processes and optimizing outcomes in my roles. My leadership experience includes serving as the President of a student NGO and mentoring students.

I'm also known to be very friendly, so feel free to connect or drop me a message for a chat! ðŸ’¬
