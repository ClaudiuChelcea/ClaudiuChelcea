### Game development

I'm passionate about the game development industry and I'm learning about developing games in Unity using C#.
<br>
<br>
I'm also currently working full-time as a Game Economy Designer at Gameloft, learning a lot and contributing to big projects like Sniper Fury and Sniper Champions.
<br><br>Alongside countless tutorials, projects and materials, I've also attended two game development summer schools with courses like: Economy Design & Game Balancing, Level Design, Rapid Game Development, 3D Modeling, VR & AR and developed alone or in a team games like: Tower Defense, Multiplayer RPG, Hyper-casual games, etc...

### &nbsp;&nbsp;Business & entrepreneurship

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides software & game development, I like to explore the business industry, self-developing &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myself through reading, taking courses about management, leadership, negotiation, and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;others.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm getting practical experience by attending seminaries, workshops, conferences, trainings &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and having the experience of being the president of a student NGO focused on the business &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;domain.

Also, I'm an investor, passionate about stocks and, as well, crypto, having experince working both as a Game Economy Designer on blockchain games, also playing these types of games, and also very thoroughly learning and developing myself in this domain.
